The journal is a new peer-reviewed and open source concept taking shape in a broken landscape of academic publishing.
It is a platform for the publication of research articles, essays, and other forms of scholarly writing. All available
for free to the online public.
It is a place for the cutting edge of computation theory, cognitive science, and philosophy of mind.
Here exists a writing place where publication of research not easily realized or understood can thrive in modern
Science. The new inroads to problem solving are laid in a new direction of thought now due to the seminal paper and
discovery of King's Demoness by the founder of Brains & Computation, Stephanie King.
While the publication is getting its sea legs, there are limitations on which geographic locales in the United States
of America may or may not participate in the activities of subscribing, submitting, and reviewing.
Since the founder is of a particularly sensitive and rare type of savant artist with severe chronic pain caused by a
neuropathology she is taking her liberty with her own work to ensure her own Constitutional right to not be forced to
give birth to a child.
When she is assured of her right in the Republican government byway of signage given by a current President, of a
Congressional bill into law and Amendment she will be able to open up the publication to the rest of the world. As long
as her right to life is taken for granted and she is not allowed to avoid further damage to her person if becoming
pregnant, she will pursue this call to action for the country to realize the value of human life is not inherent in forced
child labor. Criminalizing abortion denies the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to anyone with the
circumstances thereof and is a dangerous precedent for consent that cannot be given to be mandated at the absolute loss
of bodily rights.
Here's a thought experiment. Let's say I steal a man's sperm (gametes) and get myself pregnant with it. I am then able
to be convinced by he or someone else that it is wrong to force a child onto a man who will have to pay for that action
I took without his consent. We can all agree that forcing a child onto a man is wrong, but forcing one onto me is just
as wrong if not more so since I would pay a higher cost and risk with my own body and not only money and time. I do not
want to be forced to pay in any way any cost of having a child I did not consent to for any reason. I preemptively
reject these damages and will not accept the consequences to my life as something out of my control and left up to
someone or something else to decide for me due to unforseen or unplanned circumstances. Even if a fetus is a human
being, it is mine and inside my body. I do not owe any waste back to the people who feed me. I do not owe any man a
child, even if we decide to make one together. Agreeing to parenthood with the freedom to choose it is a much better
way of shaping one's own family and personal relationships. Do I owe a man a child if I steal his ability to make one?
Or does he owe me for having made one? We don't sustain fully grown adult human beings on life support even if their
hearts will keep beating and their lungs will keep breathing. Abortions are independent unrelated events just about
every single time and not a conspiracy to genocide populations when a single person takes the responsibility with their
own volition. There is no connection. There is no call to action. There is no movement to have them.

If the condition of a person will cause it to die, it is allowed to die. This is precedence in Western medicine, law,
and society.
